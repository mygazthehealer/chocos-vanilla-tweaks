# Chocos' Textures Tweaks

CTT is a minecraft resourcepack created to improve the vanilla building experience by correcting inconsistent textures.

Join [MCS](https://discord.com/invite/NtVxyW5) and visit the [CVT brainforum](https://discord.com/channels/308744621616529410/1243802341824663602) for discussions and suggestions for new and existing textures.

For the complete list of changes, read the [CTT Wiki](https://github.com/mygazthehealer/chocos-texture-tweaks/blob/main/TEXTURE.md). If you dislike a certain texture but still want to use the datapack, you may delete the .png and .json file corresponding to that recipe.

(I'm considering repurposing this repository for the CVT mod, with the CTT resourcepack and tge CCT datapack intended to be accompanying additions)
