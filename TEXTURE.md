# Textures
## Blocks

- **Tuff** uses old "deepslate_top" texture (fitting the Deepslate caves environment better)
- **Bamboo Planks** uses centred texture similar to other Wooden Planks (instead of copying Stripped Bamboo Block side textur)
 **Bamboo Fence** and **Bamboo Fence Gate** uses Bamboo Planks texture (instead of custom ones) similar to other Wooden Fence and Wooden Fence Gate
- **Bamboo Block** uses brighter texture (matching color pallete of Bamboo poles)
